          This group also has lore behind it. Apperantly they are timetravling
          vampires? I dont know but this music and the video reminds me of

          Last but not least we have their newer songs "Borught the heat back",
          It's sooo good the offical music video but i couldnt fins it. But the
          dance perforomance is just as good.
